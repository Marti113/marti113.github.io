Welcome to my website!

I've been programming as a hobby since 2016. In 2018, I decided to continue my studies with Computer Science classes at City College San Francisco where I completed a certificate in Java Programming. From City College I was recruited into Salesforce's Pathfinder Program where I received development training on the Force.com platform.

Recently I was accepted into Georgia Tech's MS Computer Science program. It is a part time program I plan to do in conjunction with a full time developer job.

My previous professional experience is mostly in the Non-Profit sector. At my last Non-Profit, The Night Ministry, I worked with homeless youth in Chicago. These kids had limited options for future careers. 

These kids were smart, resourceful, and resilient. I saw potential in them to learn programming and become developers. Many of them lacked the confidence to enter a challenging field like Computer Science. It's a sentiment I could relate to. I decided if I believed these kids could do it, I had to also believe I could do it. I left the Non-Profit sector soon after to pursue a career as a software engineer.   

Beyond being an awesome engineer, I want to volunteer with STEM focused organizations for kids especially in the programming field. I know my story of being an unconventional programmer would inspire other people.
